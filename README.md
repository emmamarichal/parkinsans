Parkinsans is a geometric sans serif designed for UK charity Parkinson’s UK.

Energetic, human, accessible, approachable – Parkinsans embodies Parkinson’s UK’s relentless energy, whilst typographic quirks reflect the unique experience of every Parkinson’s journey.

Consisting of 6 weights, Parkinsans is designed to grab attention at display sizes and provide an accessible, easy reading experience for short form copy.

Designed by award-winning, London based creative agency Red Stone, Parkinsans is a fork of from Indian Type Foundry's [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins).

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://github.com/redstonedesign/parkinsans`.
