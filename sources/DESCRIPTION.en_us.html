<body>
<p>Parkinsans is a geometric sans serif designed for UK charity Parkinson’s UK.</p>
<p>Energetic, human, accessible, approachable – Parkinsans embodies Parkinson’s UK’s relentless energy, whilst typographic quirks reflect the unique experience of every Parkinson’s journey.</p>
<p>Consisting of 6 weights, Parkinsans is designed to grab attention at display sizes and provide an accessible, easy reading experience for short form copy.</p>
<p>Designed by award-winning, London based creative agency Red Stone, Parkinsans is derived from Indian Type Foundry&#39;s Poppins.</p>
